# ðŸš€ API Template with Bun and Elysia 

This project is a starting point for building a robust API, using modern technologies to provide an efficient development experience.

## Included Technologies

### [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 
Bun is the chosen JavaScript runtime environment for this project.

### [ElysiaJS](https://elysia.dev/)
ElysiaJS is the web framework used, focused on providing the best development experience with minimal overhead. Supercharged by Bun, it comes with built-in support for Swagger, making API documentation accessible at "/swagger".

### [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
Prisma is the chosen ORM for data management. It simplifies database interaction, offering a powerful and efficient abstraction layer.

### [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)

### Database: PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is used as the database for this project. It provides a robust and scalable solution for managing data.

### MVC Pattern
This template follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to organize code in a modular way, making project maintenance and expansion easier.
